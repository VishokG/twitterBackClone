# twitterBackClone


Hi, This is a simple project of mine that mimicks simple core Twitter functionality: <br />
A User is able to sign-up, login <br />
They are able to tweet <br />
The logged in user is displayed tweets of users they follow in the order they are tweeted by time <br />
 <br />
Back-End: NodeJS+Express <br />
Storage: Neo4j for creating relationships between tweets and users & MongoDB for registrations <br />
Front-end: ReactJS (NOT DEVELOPED BY ME, Credits: https://github.com/CleverProgrammers/twitter-clone (A YouTuber)) (Only tweeks for connecting the two such as Axios for CORS)
